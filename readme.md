# Fract-ol

## Introduction

**Fract-ol** is a graphical project that visualizes famous mathematical fractals. Using this program, you can explore complex fractals like the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and Multibrot Mandelbrot and Julia. The goal is to render these fractals interactively, allowing zooming, color changes, and fractal manipulation.

## What are the features I can find in Fract-ol?

- **Mandelbrot Set** visualization
- **Julia Set** visualization (with customizable parameters)
- Zoom functionality to explore fractals in detail
- Color shifting to customize the fractal's appearance (Bonus)
- Optional: Other fractals (Multibrot Mandelbrot, Multibrot Julia)(Bonus)

## What do I need to try fract-ol?

- A Unix-based system (Linux or macOS)
- A C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Basic knowledge of fractals and complex numbers

This repository already includes a version of Minilibx to work in macOS. If you want to try fract-ol in a linux machine, it is necessary to replace the folder minilibx, with the version for [linux](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).
