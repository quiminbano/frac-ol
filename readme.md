# Fract-ol

## Introduction

**Fract-ol** is a graphical project that visualizes famous mathematical fractals. Using this program, you can explore complex fractals like the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and Multibrot Mandelbrot and Julia. The goal is to render these fractals interactively, allowing zooming, color changes, and fractal manipulation.

## What are the features you can find in Fract-ol?

- **Mandelbrot Set** visualization
- **Julia Set** visualization (with customizable parameters)
- Zoom functionality to explore fractals in detail
- Color shifting to customize the fractal's appearance (Bonus)
- Optional: Other fractals (Multibrot Mandelbrot, Multibrot Julia)(Bonus)
